# Snake
Behold Snake game for terminal! 
In this game you can play the classical snake game, as well as you can play 3 different levels with obstacles and periodic boundry conditions.

I made moving apples which bounce from obstacles and snake itself. I belive it brings more fun to the game :)

Just try it!

Now you can create your own level! Just choose editor in the main menu and start to create!

## Requirements
The game uses [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) library for ASCII graphics. Probably you already have it on you computer. Otherwise you can always download it for free.

## Quick Start
To install the game write in terminal:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Anny-Moon/Snake
$ cd Snake/
$ cmake .
$ sudo make install
```

To play just write:
```bash
$ snake
```
After the first run the hidden folder .snake will be created in your home folder. The game will put all the files in that folder.
