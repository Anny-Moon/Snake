# Snake
Behold Snake game for terminal! 
In this game you can play the classical snake game, as well as you can play 3 different levels with obstacles and periodic boundry conditions.

I made moving apples which bounce from obstacles and snake itself. I belive it brings more fun to the game :)

Just try it!

```
